# UMHA_WarmupScheduler
A Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach to generating a warmup schedule for UMHA

Problem Definition:
UMHA club activities include running warmups before training, which is a duty shared by the senior members of the club. The Scheduler aims to solve for a result that minimizes the overall number that any single member needs to do and thereby equitably spread the responsibility while meeting different constraints on their availability.
