# UMHA_WarmupScheduler
A Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach to generating a warmup schedule for UMHA; Non-MILP Scheduler included as an alternative

Problem Definition:
UMHA club activities include running warmups before training, which is a duty shared by the senior members of the club. The Scheduler aims to solve for a result that maximizes the time between a single member running the warmup and thereby equitably spreads the responsibility while meeting different members' constraints on their availability.
